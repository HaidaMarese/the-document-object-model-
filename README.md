# SBA- Interactive Personal Blog Platform

## Overview  
This is a simple HM-Personal Blog platform built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to create, edit, delete, and save blog posts directly in their browser using localStorage.

## Features  
- Create new posts with title and content (form validation included)  
- View all saved posts dynamically  
- Edit existing posts with validation  
- Delete posts  
- Data persistence using localStorage (posts stay after refresh)

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository : https://github.com/HaidaMarese/the-document-object-model-.git
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser  
3. Start creating and managing your blog posts instantly

## Development Reflection  
This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and localStorage management.  
The main challenge was managing edit state and ensuring data sync with localStorage. I overcame this by using a currentEditingId variable and careful state updates.

## Known Issues / Future Improvements  
- Styling could be improved for better UX  
- Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions
